Researchers are increasingly aware of the need to share all aspects of the research cycle, from pre-registered analysis plans and study materials to the data and analysis code that produce the reported results. However, much of this digital information is in a format that makes it difficult to find, access, and reuse. Additionally, best practices are evolving at a pace that is difficult for researchers to keep up with. In this talk, I will discuss the potential for automated checks of scientific papers to address these problems, and introduce {papercheck}, an application that combines simple regular expression text searching, R code, machine learning, and generative AI to assess scientific papers. This tool can be used to suggest improvements pre-publication, or to more efficiently conduct meta-scientific research on large numbers of papers.

# The Problem

## Best Practices are Rapidly Evolving

<!--
- share data, code, and materials
- correctly apply statistical methods
- declare conflicts of interests 
- transparent author contributions
- appropriately cite papers; acknowledge retractions
- avoid overclaiming and inappropriate use of causal language
-->

- All research outputs should be FAIR
- PDFs are where data goes to die
- Meta-data use cases:
    - facilitating meta-analyses
    - improving the re-use of reliable measures
    - meta-scientific research

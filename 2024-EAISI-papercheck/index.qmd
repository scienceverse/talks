Researchers are increasingly aware of the need to share all aspects of the research cycle, from pre-registered analysis plans and study materials to the data and analysis code that produce the reported results. However, much of this digital information is in a format that makes it difficult to find, access, and reuse. Additionally, best practices are evolving at a pace that is difficult for researchers to keep up with. In this talk, I will discuss the potential for automated checks of scientific papers to address these problems, and introduce {papercheck}, an application that combines simple regular expression text searching, R code, machine learning, and generative AI to assess scientific papers. This tool can be used to suggest improvements pre-publication, or to more efficiently conduct meta-scientific research on large numbers of papers.
